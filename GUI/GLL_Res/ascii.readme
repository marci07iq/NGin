Place a font file "ascii.png" in this folder.

It must contain a 16x16 grid of images in black-and-white
Only red channle used, as alpha channle for drawing (black = transparent)
Arrange by ASCII codes left to right, top to bottom.

Tools like http://www.lmnopc.com/bitmapfontbuilder/ may help.
This is purely a suggestion, I accept no liablity for that website, and it's contents.

All fonts will be rendered monospace.
